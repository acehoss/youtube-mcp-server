# YouTube MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integrating YouTube functionality with AI language models. It uses YouTube.js (youtubei.js) to access YouTube's internal API without requiring API keys.

## Deployment

This server can be deployed in multiple ways:

1. Via npx (recommended):
   ```
   npx github:acehoss/youtube-mcp-server
   ```

2. As a local npm package:
   ```
   npm install youtube-mcp-server
   ```

3. Via Docker deployment:
   The server includes a Dockerfile for containerized deployment.

## Configuration

No configuration or API keys required! YouTube.js handles all authentication internally.

## API Endpoints

The server provides the following MCP methods:

- `videos.getVideo`: Get detailed information about a YouTube video
- `videos.searchVideos`: Search for videos on YouTube
- `videos.getTrending`: Get trending videos

1. The server has internet access to connect to YouTube
2. The Docker build process has sufficient resources (if using Docker)
3. Node.js version 16 or higher is installed
